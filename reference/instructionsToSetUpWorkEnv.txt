Instructions to set up work environment:

1. Use my MySQLWorkbench to connect to remote SQL server with the following information:
    Endpoint: project-4347-db.cblupithxisz.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
    Username: admin
    Password: 4347Password!

2.  If for some reason the database is empty or not created, use the appropriate .sql files and their queries in /reference to create and populate the database.
